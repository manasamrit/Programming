    "App Description:\n",
    "This app is a weather information retrieval tool that allows users to get the current weather details of a specific city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and displays essential information such as temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed for the requested city. The app is written in Python and can be run from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Issues to Work Upon:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: Improve the error handling mechanism to provide more informative and user-friendly error messages for different scenarios, such as network errors, invalid API keys, or unavailable city data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid city name and prevent potential errors or unexpected behavior caused by incorrect input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit Testing: Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests to verify the functionality of the app and ensure that it handles different scenarios correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Interface: Enhance the user interface by creating a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web-based interface to provide a more intuitive and visually appealing way for users to interact with the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting: Extend the app's capabilities to provide weather forecasts for upcoming days in addition to the current weather. This can be achieved by utilizing the forecast data provided by the OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Localization: Implement support for multiple languages and allow users to view weather information in their preferred language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching: Implement a caching mechanism to store previously fetched weather data, reducing the number of API calls and improving response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Reporting: Include error reporting functionality to track and log errors encountered by users, assisting in identifying and resolving issues more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to provide appropriate documentation and instructions in your GitHub repository to guide users on how to set up and use the app effectively."
